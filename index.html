        <h3>The Island</h3>
        <p>The island is in the Bermuda Triangle and has near constant fog cover. There is no volcano above the
            surface, but the ocean around it is essentially boiling with underwater volcanic activity.
            The island is large and has heavy foliage, and the isolated nature of the island has simulateously
            preserved and mutated the local flora and fauna. Thankfully, there is a lot of prey animals.
            Unfortunately, a lot of the predators don't look like predators.
            This island has been visited by humans in the past, as is evidenced by the airplanes scattered
            across the canopy and the pieces of ships washed up on the beach. There are also some leftover
            shelters from previous survivors!
            However, there are no permanent human residents on the island.
